Project work describes an eCommerce framework on Spring boot microservices
architecture. Almost all the eCommerce frameworks available in the market are on monolithic
architecture. In this work, we break down monolithic architecture components into smaller
microservices that can be extended, improve independently, and add new services/features
separately on top of that and brings the power of microservices to eCommerce which allows
implementing features that are very difficult to achieve with a monolithic architecture.
